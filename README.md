============

An AppleScript to get a URL to a random gif from Instant Cosby from [Alfred App](http://alfredapp.com/). You will need Alfred and the Powerpack to use this.

Installation

Double click on the extension file.

How to use
----------------

Once installed with Alfred you can run the following commands

    cosby
    - Then paste from your clipboard. Totally random at this time.


Shell Script
----------------
* You can use just the shell script as well
* Simply save cosby.sh to your filesystem, then chmod 775 cosby.sh, then run ./cosby.sh
* That will save a random Bill Cosby gif to your clipboard (OS X only)
* Hint: create an alias to: $ cd /your/dir ; sudo ./cosby.sh
